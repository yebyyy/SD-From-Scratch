# SD-From-Scratch

Follows Umar Jamil's [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI&t=397s) and the papers [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239) and [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752) to build Stable Diffusion Model from scratch.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Stable diffusion model includes **Variational Autoencoder(VAE)** from the paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114), **Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training(CLIP)** proposed by OpenAI in the paper [Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020), **U-Net** from the paper [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597),
